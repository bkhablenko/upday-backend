## Notes

This project is not perfect and could be improved in certain areas.

### CI

- [ ] Build the app and run tests with Docker Compose
- [ ] Split the pipeline into multiple jobs
- [ ] Configure [parallelism](https://circleci.com/docs/parallelism-faster-jobs/)
- [ ] Scan project dependencies for vulnerabilities

### CD

- [ ] Create a Helm chart to deploy the app in K8s

### API Security

Ideally, we'd use OAuth 2 with [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/). Given the time constraint, however, some endpoints require `Basic` authentication instead.

(In-memory user credentials: `admin:p@55sw0rd`.)

### Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is out of the scope of this project, but it's something that we'd definitely need in a production environment.

### Error Handling

Currently, the error response structure is inconsistent.

To fix that, consider extending [`ResponseEntityExceptionHandler`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/servlet/mvc/method/annotation/ResponseEntityExceptionHandler.html). 

### Caching

Once published, news articles rarely change. It makes sense to cache them for improved performance.

### Pagination

There's none :shrug: Consider extending [`PagingAndSortingRepository`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/repository/PagingAndSortingRepository.html).

### Observability

- [x] ~~Write app logs as JSON~~
- [ ] Configure log collection (e.g., [Fluentd](https://www.fluentd.org/))
- [x] ~~Expose Prometheus metrics at http://localhost:8080/metrics~~
- [ ] Set up a [RED dashboard](https://grafana.com/blog/2018/08/02/the-red-method-how-to-instrument-your-services/) with Grafana
- [ ] Configure tracing and trace collection

### Other

- [ ] Configure DB connection pool
- [ ] Validate `@RequestBody` payloads
